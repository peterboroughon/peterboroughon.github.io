## An Experiment 

I am making this webpage to learn how to use Github Pages. The process 
seems fairly simple, but is a little confusing in some ways. You will want to 
make a complete website, not just a single page, and you may want to include 
images and links to other media and other websites. Where do images go for example?
Are they loaded into the github repository?
